# Notes

## Header File
If we want to use some built-in functions of the C programming language, then we should use header files.  
For example, if we want to use the `printf` function, then we need to use the `stdio.h` header file.

## Main Function
C programming language runs the program from the `main` function.

### Main Function Structure:
```c
int main() {
    // anything to do here

    return 0;
}


### How to works

C programming language executes from the `main` function. After all functionalities are done into main function then we should do return 0; return 0 means the compiler understand everything executed successfully without any problems.

If we want to use any built-in functions of the C programming language then must be use header files on top.

stdio.h -> stdio: Standard input output and .h means header file

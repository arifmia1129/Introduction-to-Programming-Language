## Notes

### Header File
If we want to use some built-in functions of the C programming language, then we should use header files.  
For example, if we want to use the `printf` function, then we need to use the `stdio.h` header file.

### Main Function
C programming language runs the program from the `main` function.

### Main Function Structure:
```c
int main() {
    // anything to do here

    return 0;
}
```


### How to works

C programming language executes from the `main` function. After all functionalities are done into main function then we should do return 0; return 0 means the compiler understand everything executed successfully without any problems.

If we want to use any built-in functions of the C programming language then must be use header files on top.

stdio.h -> stdio: Standard input output and .h means header file


### Variables and data types
If we want to store anything then need to declare variables.

The mainly used data types in C programming language:
1. int -> 101, -205, 5
2. float -> 2.5, -10.45, 5.4
3. char -> 'a', 'b', '@'
4. bool -> true, false


### Size of data types

1. int -> 4 byte (32 bit)
2. float -> 4 byte (32 bit)
3. char -> 1 byte (8 bit)

 * 1 byte -> 8 bit (1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0)

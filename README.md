# Notes

## Header File
If we want to use some built-in functions of the C programming language, then we should use header files.  
For example, if we want to use the `printf` function, then we need to use the `stdio.h` header file.

## Main Function
C programming language runs the program from the `main` function.

### Main Function Structure:
```c
int main() {
    // anything to do here

    return 0;
}
